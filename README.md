# Description

This project is part of Task 3 of my Data Science Internship at CodTech IT Solutions, where I completed a full end-to-end machine learning project. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model building, and deployment using Flask. The goal is to demonstrate how a data-driven solution can be developed and deployed as a web application for real-world use.

A trained model is integrated into a Flask web app, which is hosted on Render, allowing users to make predictions through a user-friendly interface. This project showcases my ability to apply data science concepts in a practical, production-ready manner.
